In the game, each player takes the role of a member of a species, and tries to survive,
competing in real time with other players, as well as AIs.
Throughout the game, a moderator will be able to change its parameters in real time,
allowing the players to observe the effects and transforming the game into a tool for
scientific inquiry.
